🔭 I’m currently working on  
Building a **web-based HRMS (Human Resource Management System)** with features like daily attendance, and planning to expand into payroll & leave management using **Laravel, React, TypeScript, and ShadCN UI**.

🌱 I’m currently learning  
Deepening my knowledge in **System Design**, **Object-Oriented Programming (Java)**, and **scalable full-stack architecture**, while sharpening my **TypeScript & React** skills.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on  
Open-source or real-world projects related to **web applications**, **internal company systems**, or **productivity tools**.

🤔 I’m looking for help with  
Best practices for **clean architecture**, **system scalability**, and **advanced backend–frontend integration**.

💬 Ask me about  
React, TypeScript, Laravel, REST APIs, basic networking concepts, or building CRUD-based systems.
